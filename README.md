### What I learned

I learned so much from this project, as this was one of my first project built with React! It's really a wounderful framework to code and very easy. I'm defently going to do a lot more project with React and React native.


### Continued development

I will ofcourse continue develop with React and get Pro with itm yes it's wasy but, there is a few things which was hard to understand and I had to watch some videos on YouTube and other platforms to really know what that thing is doing.
